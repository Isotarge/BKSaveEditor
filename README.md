#Banjo Kazooie Save Editor
Save editor for Banjo Kazooie which currently supports the .eep and .SaveRAM files created by many common emulators and flash carts.

This would not have been possible without the checksum algorithm which was reversed by [bryc](https://github.com/bryc/rare-n64-chksm)

##Compiling
Compiles with Visual Studio 2015, no extra libraries needed.
